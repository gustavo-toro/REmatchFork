## Meeting with Pierre Thursday, September 16th:

### Summary

 - About my implementation for checking the automaton's ambiguity:
     - I got the pipeline wrong for the benchmarking stage. I thought that we were supposed to add weights to several RegEx, turn them into automata and then check for ambiguity. Turns out that a much better pipeline is:
        1. Fully determinize the regexes and turn them into files.
        2. Use these files with the new algorithm.
    - Maybe there's a better way to check for ambiguity at the parsing regex stage: [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540197926882).
- Explained in a broad way the different interfaces (method signatures) regarding the DS of the algorithm.
    - Have to start with the algorithm implementation. After that we can start plugging different DSs.
    - The tentative structure for the APIs could be the following:
        1. At the first level we should have an interface for the ```HoW``` DS.
        2. However this should inherit. Maybe we can think in a way for inheriting from a ```Queue``` base class that implements the common methods: ```FindMin```, ```DeleteMin```, ```Meld```, ```Add```, ```ExtendBy```.
        3. As a middle inheritance we should then plug a way to have ```IncreaseBy```, effectively turning a ```Queue``` into a ```HoW```.
        4. We should also allow different template levels of ```Queues```. Maybe with different notions of fully-persistency.

### Work to do

1. Read more closely the paper, understand the DS API better (I already understand the algorithm).
2. Start plugging the algorithm to REmatch. Notice the templates and inheritances discussed.
3. Think about the possibility of generalizing the addition of ```IncreaseBy``` to a ```Queue``` base class.
4. Need to prepare a general introduction for Jérémy to the problem.
